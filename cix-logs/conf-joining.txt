The purpose of the hard_drive conference is to be a central reference 
point for all questions, queries and answers regarding the use of hard 
drives, such as cmos and jumper settings. As far as I am aware, there is 
no presence (official or otherwise) with anyone connected with the 
various companies who make hard drives.

Vendors may post prices if requested, but please don't turn my conference 
into a n advert bill board.

The conference is broken down into two kinds of topic, the chatter topic 
where all the questions can be asked (and a flist for disk utilities), 
and the other topics for : 
        
        Conner
        Fujitsu
        Future Domain        
        Maxtor
        Micropolis
        Miniscribe
        Quantum
        Seagate
        Western Digital

which are read only, and are full of files containing cmos and jumper 
settings. If you can't find the information you need in the various 
flists, we would all be grateful if you could upload or post the info 
when you do find it, so we can keep the flists uptodate.
