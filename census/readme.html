It's census time here in the Vienna conference.  This is
the one you cannot afford to miss! Your  participation
will be most welcome and it will help the Vienna developers
in the future development of Vienna.

How to participate.
------------------
Download cixfile:vienna/files:census.zip
(It's tiny)

Open Vienna and navigate to Vienna -> About Vienna
Make a note of Vienna version information, N.N.NN (NNNN)

Create an empty folder in your home folder and name it
"census". Unzip the zip file into it.

If you have any work that you have copied to the clipboard,
please save it now.

Open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal

Yes, I know it is the command line. I'm very sorry
for those of you who are averse to the command line, but
this is the simplest way for me to implement a simple
survey.

In Terminal window type:

      cd census
      sh census.sh

A prompt will appear. Please answer the question
with your Cix nickname.

Another prompt will appear. Please answer the question
with the Vienna version information.

When you have done that, your default email program
will open with the To: and Subject: fields already
filled in. 

We are almost done. A tiny program has copied the
census data to your clipboard. Paste the clipboard
to the message window. At the top of the window,
add any comments you can think of, taking care
not to disturb the census data.

When you finished typing your comment, send the message.

That's it. Job done. Simples. Thanks for your participation.
It will help us in the future development of Vienna.

For the security conscious.
