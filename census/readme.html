It's census time here in the Vienna conference.  This is
the one you cannot afford to miss! Your  participation
will be most welcome and it will help the Vienna developers
in the future development of Vienna.

What's being collected?  - see below

How to participate.
------------------
Download cixfile:vienna/files:census.zip
(It's tiny, < 5k)

Open Vienna and navigate to Vienna -> About Vienna
Make a note of Vienna version information, N.N.NN (NNNN)

Create an empty folder in your home folder and name it
"census". Unzip the zip file into it.

If you have any work that you have copied to the clipboard,
please save it now.

Open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal

Yes, I know it is the command line. I'm very sorry
for those of you who are averse to the command line, but
this is the simplest way for me to implement a simple
survey.

In Terminal window type:

      cd census
      sh census.sh

You will be asked if you wish to view the documentation in
your browser. Answer Y or N.

A prompt will appear. Please answer the question
with your Cix nickname.

Another prompt will appear. Please answer the question
with the Vienna version information or "none" if you do
not have Vienna..

You will be asked if you wish to send the census data.
Answer Y (default) or N

When you have done that, your default email program
will open with the To: and Subject: fields already
filled in. 

We are almost done. A tiny program has copied the
census data to your clipboard. 

Now for the important step!

=== Paste the clipboard into the message window. ===

Take care not to disturb the census data.

Now send the message.

That's it. Job done. Simples. Thanks for your participation.
It will help us in the future development of Vienna.

Problems
--------
When pasting the clipboard into Thunderbird, it sometimes comes up with
a message "Found an attachment keyword XX". It is trying to be too
clever. Close the yellow window by clicking on the litte X icon
on the right and send the message as usual.

For the security conscious.
---------------------------

Q: What information is being gathered?

Most of this information is gathered by the script automatically.

Your Vienna version.
Whether you have the development system installed and which
version.
Your Mac's hostname.
Your cix nickname and login name on your Mac.
System log messages that relate to Vienna.
A list of Crash Reporter files that relate to Vienna. We don't collect
the files at the moment..

Q: How do I find out what is being sent?

A:
Read the file temporary-file in the census directory.
Review the script census.sh.

Q: What programs are used to create the census.

A: census.sh - a small Bash shell script available for review by anyone.
Standard system utilities such as gzip bzcat pbcopy grep uuencode
hostname uname uuidgen and (if it exists) xcodebuild.
Your default email application.

Q: Why is the census data sent in BASE64 or UUencoded form?

A: To prevent long lines from getting mangled. The data are also
compressed.

Q: Why are the system log messages relating to Vienna being gathered?

any that I have not seen before.

Privacy Policy
--------------
Your personal data (email address, login name, cix nickname, hostname)
will not be shared with anyone.

You do not have to give your cix nickname to participate but I would
much prefer that you do give it.

The script will install a small cookie in ~/Library/Vienna/Vienna.cookie
It contains a UUID. Please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID
Please do not delete this file. It is used to identify your Mac
anonymously in the event you send more than one report.
