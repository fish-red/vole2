Input:	a C-string of possibly multiple lines containing
	a mixture of CP1252 and UTF-8 and possibly invalid code points.

call:

int cputf8(char * instring, size_t in_size, char *outstring,
         size_t out_size, bool unicode_entities, bool cp1252_entities,
	 int *error, char **error_msg);

char * instring 	A pointer to the input string.
size_t in_size		The length of the input string.
char * outstring	A pointer to the output string buffer.
size_t outsize		The length of the output buffer.
bool unicode_entities   Use Vole Unicode Entities for all codepoints 
			not in CP1252.
bool cp1252)entities    Use Vole Unicode Entities for all codepoints
			0x80 and above.
int *error		A pointer to an error code when returning.
char **error_msg	A pointer to an error message when returning. 

Returns
-------
	This function returns an integer.
	0 = No error
	1 = Out of memory. You should allocate more memory to the output buffer
	    and retry the call with the same input buffer.
        2 = An invalid codepoint was detected.
