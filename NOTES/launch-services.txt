Fun with Launch Services

I have a folder containing lots of Voles with debugging symbols
which are used with the debugger to find the line in source
code for a Crash Report. Fortunately these are rare, touch wood.

Launch Services, the part of OS X which deals with starting Apps,
was getting very confused with all my Voles.  I could
not persuade it that I really did not want to run
one of the Voles in the debugging folder as the default app
for a cix: URL

Eventually I discovered an undocumented command 'lsregister'
which can be used by Launch Services to rescan the system.

It is also possible to dump the LS database to see what is
going on. 'lsregister -dump'

After re-scanning the system and 'touching' the Vole that I
wanted to be the default, all was back to normal again.
