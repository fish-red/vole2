Eureka moment 2 of 2 - Vole Unicode entities

Appicable to Vole 1

The Vole 1 SQLite database is encoded in CP 1252.

The 3 Vole/Vienna developers got this wrong. Mea Culpa. This did
not matter in the early days of Vienna as there was no such thing
as CIX Reader, CIX forums or iXOLR, which are all generating
messages in UTF-8.

Had we read an obscure part of the SQLIte documentation we would
have found there were only two recommended encodings, UTF-8 and UTF-16, 
which are set when the database is created. 

We now need a method of encoding arbitrary Unicode chars in a CP1252 string
so as to maintain compatibilty with Vole 1 database.

I did think of using HTML entities such as &#x1F4A9; but these are quite
likely to occcur in Cix messages like the html conference or this one.

I have now come up with a method which is invisible to the user and is
backward compatible with older versions of Vole should a user revert to
one. It is only used internally by Vole and will be filtered out 
if a user copies and pastes into a posting. Or if a user exports a message.

The scheme is quite simple. The characters are saved as 

<STX>[U+XXX]<ETX>

where <STX> is ASCII control char 0x0002  #START OF TEXT
and   <ETX> is ASCII control char 0x0003  #END OF TEXT
and XXX is the codepoint in uper case hexdecimal, as many
HEX digits as required.

Example:        <STX>[U+296F]<ETX>
 
should you ever feel the need to post
296F DOWNWARDS HARPOON WITH BARB LEFT BESIDE UPWARDS HARPOON WITH BARB RIGHT

The two control characters never occur in CIX messages and they can always
be filtered out by the CIX message processor of Vole should some
joker decide to post a message with a Vole Unicode entity.
