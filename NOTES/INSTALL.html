Vinkix was formerly known as Vienna.

If you already have Vienna installed, please make sure that you
have a copy of the zip file that you used to install it. This
file is probably named vt-1.6.0.zip or vt-1.6.1.zip and is
required in case you have to reinstall Vienna in the event
that Vinkix testing release does not work.

Now drag all instances of Vienna-OLR to the Trash. This is
important otherwise the apps will fight each other for control
of the cix: and cixfile: hotlinks. Use Finder if necessary
to find all instances of Vienna-OLR. You can leave instances
of Vienna-2 RSS reader where they are.

The first time you use Vinkix to connect to CIX you will
probably be asked for your CIX password. Don't panic, this
is quite normal. Your password will be saved in your Login
Keychain under name Vinkix:CIX.
