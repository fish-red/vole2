Release notes for version 1.6.0
===============================

"Set cix back one day" will result in malformed messages in inactive topics.
Replace "head skip to back 1" with "skip ot back 1"

Show Windows Characters menu option is now always ON.

Update to sqlite3.[ch] version 3.7.6.1  This is the database back-end.

Make sure we retain fonts so as to avert a crash on Leopard and
Snow Leopard versions. This did not seem to bother the Tiger version
for some unexplained reason.

Make sure not to prematurely release an object. This was causing a 
crash in messages which use styles. Only affected the Leopard and
Snow Leopard builds.

Fix the selectRow:byExtendingSelection system log message.

Fix a couple of system log messages. There are still a few left.

Set marketing version to 1.6.0.

Filter the undefined characters in Windows Code Page 1252 out of
messages. We turn them into question marks.

Convert all the uses of default character set (Mac OS Roman) to
use Windows CP1252.

When importing messages from a scratchpad, mark messages as 'unread'.
This is a possible candidate for a user option in a future version.

When blinking, retrieve all messages including those that have been
withdrawn by user, moderator or system manager. This could be a user
option in a later version.

Remove much of the deprecated API.

Update acronyms.lst, downloaded from CIX acronyms conference.

Fetch source from SourceForge for version 1.5.14
