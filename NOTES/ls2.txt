More fun with Launch Services.

This is of interest to anyone who is testing new apps in general,
not just Vole. It also applies to anyone who has multiple
copies of an App installed.

Things don't work the way you think they do! 
Beware of surpising effects. You might not be testing
the app you think you are.

Vole has a menu item 'Vole->Develop->Info About Vole'.
This opens a pane with information about Vole, particularly
the Location of the Vole app that is running. This has been
very useful to me in debugging Launch Services.

There are several ways to open an App.

1) Click on it in Finder.
   This method is the most definitive. AFAICS you will open
   the App you were expecting.

2) Click on it in Launch Pad. Only one instance of the App
will be shown. Lauuch Pad seems to search a list of known
locations in the order [home folder]/Applications,
/Applications, (and where else?) More research is needed
on this.

3) From the Terminal command line

open -a Vole

This seems to open the App last opened by Finder or LaunchPad.

If the Launch Services database has been reinitialised
and the App has never been opened by Finder or Launch Pad,
the App opened could be from almost anywhere. 

4) From the Terminal command line, specifying an App bundle
in the fileystem.

open /Users/testing/Vole-source/build/Vole.app

You get exactly what you asked for, assuming the bundle exists.

5) From the Terminal Command line, specifying a URL

open cix:vienna/files:1

The App that runs could be anywhere, it will not necessarily
be the one you opened in 3) or 4)

6) From a Web Browser, clicking on a URL.

Presumably this ought to be the same as 5)
