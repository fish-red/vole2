More fun with Launch Services.

This is of interest to anyone who is testing new apps in general,
not just Vole. It also applies to anyone who has multiple
copies of an App installed.

Things don't work the way you think they do! 
Beware of surpising effects. You might not be testing
the app you think you are.

Vole has a menu item 'Vole->Develop->Info About Vole'.
This opens a pane with information about Vole, particularly
the Location of the Vole app that is running. This has been
very useful to me in debugging Launch Services.

There are several ways to open an App.

1) Click on it in Finder.
   This method is the most definitive. AFAICS you will open
   the App you were expecting.

2) Click on it in Launch Pad. Only one instance of the App
will be shown. Lauuch Pad seems to search a list of known
locations in the order [home folder]/Applications,
/Applications, (and where else?). More research is needed
on this.

3) From the Terminal command line

open -a Vole

This seems to open the App last opened by Finder or LaunchPad.

If the Launch Services database has been reinitialised and
new copies of the App have been installed since then,
and the App has never been opened by Finder or Launch Pad,
the App opened could be from almost anywhere. 

4) From the Terminal command line, specifying an App bundle
in the fileystem.

$ open /Users/testing/Vole-source/build/Vole.app

You get exactly what you asked for, assuming the bundle exists.

5) From the Terminal command line, specifying a URL

$ open cix:vienna/files:1

The App that runs could be anywhere, it will not necessarily
be the one you opened in 3) or 4)

6) From a Web Browser, clicking on a URL.

Presumably this ought to be the same as 5)

========
Q. When multiple copies of an App exist on the filesystem and they are
registered with Launch Services by virtue of being opened
with Finder or Launch Pad, registered with lsregister, touched with
'/usr/bin/touch' or moved into place with '/bin/mv', how
does Launch Services determine which one to run?

A. You would think there is an algorithm, but this does not seem to
be the case. It does not seem to be determined by the App
short version (example 1.6.19), the long version (also known as the
build in the messages announcing new versions of Vole
in the files topic), example 20170110.123420.12, or anything else
that I can see.

Launch Services certainly does not seem to pick the latest version.

If no new copies of the App have been generated, the copy that
Launch Services will run is always the same, but it is not
possible to predict which one.

=====
The moral of this message, according to a posting in the Apple
developer forums, is that you must always do the final testing
of an App in a clean machine without the developer tools installed,
and without multiple copies of the App installed.

This is where Virtual Machines come in handy.
