Vole hangs while posting a message during a blink.

There have been quite a few complaints in the
past about Vole hanging during a blink and
failing to post a message. To add insult to injury,
Vole then goes and deletes the message from the
Out Basket, psssibly wasting hours of work.

In the past, I have never mamaged to duplicate
this bug. I suspect it depends on the contents
of the message.

Today it hapened to me. Looking at the 
Activity Window, Vole was waiting for a prompt
from Cix after posting the last line of the message.

I copied the contents of the Activity Window to the
clipboard and Force Quitted Vole. I also
killed the ssh process, which Vole uses, from the
command line.

I then saved the clipboard to a file, which I have
preserved in the Vole source repository as:

BUGS/vole_hangs_while_posting_this_message.txt

I then tried posting the message in my test conference
and Vole hanged in the same place.

Having a reproducible bug means it is now possible
to find out what is breaking Vole.

Stay tuned for updates.
