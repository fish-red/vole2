Could someone translate
 
"ΜΑΙΚ ΛΥΠΑΜΑΙ ΠΑΡΑ ΠΟΛΥ ΣΟΥ ΕΥΧΟΜΑΙ ΠΕΡΑΣΤΙΚΑ ΚΑΙ ΣΙΔΕΡΕΝΙΟΣ" for me please?
 
Google translate says "Mike I am so sorry I wish passers AND IRON" which I suspect may not be correct.
 
This is reply from a greek friend when I emailed to tell him I wouldn't see him this summer as I am awaiting surgery.

TIA Mike
