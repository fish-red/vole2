Looking at the amount of breakage today, nothing is
really safe apart from pure 7-bit ASCII.

Pros:

Easy to implement.  There is plenty of tested code
in, for example, the text mode browser Lynx which
we can 'borrow'.

Current usage of the & character is quite low.
In my archive of scratchpads totalling 220MB
there are 22,000 &s.

Can be implemented by OLR authors independently of
CIX.

For browser use, such as Forums, the conversion
back to normal text will occur automatically --
or will it?  Here's a test Euro sign here >&euro;<
Maybe this should be a con.

With hexadecimal entities we can encode all
of Unicode. If people want to use Emoji or
Glagolitic, they can.
&#x1F3E9; is apparently the Emoji for love hotel.

Cons:

Will make lines longer and may trigger word-wrapping
in OLRs such as Vole when uploading to CoSy.  This
is another broken mis-feature of Cix

It will cause confusion in conferences which discuss HTML
such as the html conference and this one. But hey, we're
geeks well able to look after ourselves..
