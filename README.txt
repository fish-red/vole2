This is the root directory for the Vole off-line reader for Cix project.

Vole was formerly known as Vienna or Vinkix, and you will see many historical
references to them.

The source code for Vole is in the Vienna directory. It is simply
too painful to rename it as Fossil does not know about directory versioning.

Requirements to run:

      Mac OS X Tiger or later. PowerPC or Intel

Requirements to build:

      Xcode 3.2.6 and a Mac OS X that supports it (Snow Leopard or later)
